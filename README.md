# travel-around

Started coding: dec, 2018.

This is one of my first practice projects i made. 

I made this in december 2018, 2 weeks in my study as web developer. 

I only learned the basics about HTML and CSS and very little about JavaScript. 

The idea was a travel website, and I really wanted to make a changing background image on the page with JavaScript. 

The image is stretched out but you get the idea!
